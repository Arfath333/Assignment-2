        <h1>1. What Is Chop Suey?</h1>
        Chop suey is a beloved Chinese American dish that originated in the late
        1800s when Chinese immigrants came to the United States to work on the
        transcontinental railroad. With the introduction of Chinese culinary
        techniques and flavors to the United States, Chinese food gained
        popularity, and chop suey became a favorite American dish. As Chinese
        immigrants have opened Chinese American restaurants across the United
        States, chop suey has evolved. This recipe is one of many variations.
        The name "chop suey" means "miscellaneous pieces," referencing the
        variety of ingredients used. The dish is designed to use any available
        ingredients to prevent waste. While there are many variations of chop
        suey, the dish typically consists of one type of protein (usually either
        chicken or pork) with an assortment of stir-fried vegetables and a
        gravy-like sauce.
