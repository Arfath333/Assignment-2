      Make the sesame dressing: Pour the oil into a small microwave-safe bowl or
      glass measuring cup. Cover it tightly with plastic wrap and use a paring
      knife to poke a hole in plastic wrap so steam can escape. Microwave on
      high until the oil is very hot, about 3 minutes. Carefully remove and
      discard plastic wrap. Stir in the grated garlic and ginger (you should
      hear sizzling), and let it stand for 5 minutes. You can cook the broccoli
      in the meantime. Whisk in the vinegar, soy sauce, sesame oil, sesame
      seeds, salt, and crushed red pepper flakes, if using.

      Cook the broccoli: Place the broccoli florets in a large microwave-safe
      bowl (we used a 8-cup glass measuring cup) and pour 3/4 cup water over the
      broccoli. Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap, and microwave on high
      until broccoli is tender-crisp, 5 to 7 minutes, stirring halfway through
      and re-covering the bowl. Carefully remove the plastic wrap and drain the
      broccoli into a colander set in the sink, and transfer it back into the
      bowl.

      Toss and serve: Pour the prepared dressing over the cooked broccoli and
      toss to evenly coat. Garnish with more sesame seeds. Serve immediately or
      let it stand at room temperature for 20 minutes to let flavors meld. Did
